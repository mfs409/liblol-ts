# Testing

To test, you need to build the TypeScript into a single JavaScript file, and 
then serve everything using some sort of web server.  The easiest way is to
use the npm http-server package.  To install it, type 
`npm install  http-server -g`.  You can then serve the root directory of this
repository by typing `http-server`.
